🔍 Netflix Content & User Behavior Dashboard
📊 Built using Tableau Desktop | Data Source: Excel
I’m excited to showcase my latest analytics project — an interactive Netflix user behavior dashboard developed end-to-end using Excel and Tableau. This dashboard demonstrates how powerful business insights can be extracted from raw structured data using visual analytics and storytelling.

🧠 Project Objective
To analyze Netflix’s global content catalog and provide a clear visual narrative on trends in content type, genre distribution, platform engagement, and country-level preferences — all designed to simulate how a data analyst at a media/OTT company would deliver insights to stakeholders for content planning, marketing, and product strategy.

📁 Data Preparation (Excel):
Source: Raw Netflix catalog data in .xlsx format

Preprocessing:
Removed nulls and cleaned inconsistent genre labels
Formatted date columns for Tableau compatibility
Created a master dataset with calculated fields like content age, region, and format groupings

Goal: Ensure the dataset was analytics-ready for Tableau ingestion with minimal latency

🧰 Tools Used:
Excel: Data cleaning, transformation, normalization, calculated helper columns

Tableau Desktop: Data modeling, calculated fields, advanced charting, parameterized filters, and dashboard composition

📌 Dashboard Features:
1️⃣ Global KPIs & Overview Panel
Interactive counters showing total content count, most common genres, type breakdown (TV Shows vs. Movies)
% of content rated by category (TV-MA, PG, etc.)

2️⃣ Genre Trend Insights
Dynamic bar charts displaying top genres globally and regionally
Identified genre saturation and demand concentration (e.g., drama, documentary)

3️⃣ Country-Level Analytics
Drill-down filter to inspect content by country
View country-specific release patterns and format preferences

4️⃣ Release Timeline
Area and line graphs showing title release frequency by year
Insights into content release trends and production cycles

5️⃣ Format Distribution
Pie chart comparing the ratio of Movies vs TV Shows
Used to infer consumption trends and strategic focus areas

6️⃣ Interactive Filters
Region selector, year filter, and genre dropdown
Empower users to explore tailored scenarios

📊 Analytical Skills Demonstrated:
Data Modeling: Created relationships and hierarchies in Tableau
Calculated Fields: Used to derive content age, release buckets, and format segments
Dashboard Design: Clean layout, hover tooltips, dynamic filters, and actionable visuals
User-Centric Thinking: Designed for non-technical users to easily extract insights

💡 Key Insights (Simulated Use Cases):
📌 India and the US contributed the highest volume of content
🎥 Drama emerged as the most dominant genre across markets
📈 Most content was released in the post-2017 window, indicating accelerated production cycles
📊 Countries like Canada and the UK showed a higher preference for TV Shows over Movies

🎯 Business Application (Hypothetical Use Case for Netflix):
Content Strategy Teams can decide what genres or formats to prioritize in upcoming quarters
Regional Managers can identify underrepresented markets or genres
Marketing can align campaigns with high-engagement genres or newly released clusters
Executives can quickly evaluate content trends without running SQL or digging into spreadsheets

📽️ I’ve also attached a video demo to walk through the full dashboard functionality in action.
